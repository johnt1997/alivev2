Washington also led a force of raw troops who were difficult to manage, relying on the guidance of experienced officers like Van Braam and Native allies such as Half-King.

This incident provoked a French military response, forcing Washington to await their onslaught at Fort Necessity. Later, in 1755, Washington participated in the Braddock Expedition, a British campaign to dislodge the French from the Forks of the Ohio. Despite Washington's advice to abandon heavy wagons for faster movement through the wilderness, General Braddock insisted on traditional tactics, leading to the British force becoming dispersed and vulnerable.

Washington had to address issues such as preventing soldiers from deserting by forbidding communication with certain civilians, maintaining camp hygiene to prevent sickness, and regulating the use of drums as signals to avoid confusion. Additionally, he struggled with the lack of adequate nursing care and the difficulties in maintaining troop morale and discipline, especially given the militia's lack of military experience and the temptation for desertion.
