He then continued alone to report back to the Colonial government in Williamsburg, producing a detailed 7000-word report and map of French forts along the upper Ohio River. This report highlighted French activities and their goal of occupying the Ohio Valley west of the English Colonies, drawing considerable attention and placing Washington in a position of notoriety on both sides of the Atlantic. Later, in April 1754, as a newly promoted Lieutenant Colonel, Washington led 140 men to the Forks of the Ohio, where a smaller English group had been chased away by a superior French force. Upon hearing of a French diplomatic mission sent to parley, Washington, unaware of their peaceful intent, ambushed the party, killing ten Frenchmen including Ensign Joseph de Jumonville. This incident provoked a French military response. Subsequently, during the Braddock Expedition, Washington served alongside British regulars under General Braddock. Despite Washington's advice to dispense with wagons for faster movement through the unblazed wilderness, Braddock refused. The British forces became dispersed and were ambushed by French and Indian forces near the Monongahela River. Washington played a significant role in the battle, as many British officers were wounded or killed, and colonial troops faced friendly fire from British soldiers who mistook them for the enemy.
