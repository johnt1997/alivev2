In January 1754, at age 22, Washington was ambushed by a traitorous Indian guide but managed to reach John Frazier's trading post. He then continued alone to report back to the Colonial government in Williamsburg, producing a detailed 7000-word report and map of French forts along the upper Ohio River. This report highlighted French activities and their goal of occupying the Ohio Valley west of the English Colonies, drawing considerable attention and placing Washington in a position of notoriety on both sides of the Atlantic. Later, in April 1754, as a newly promoted Lieutenant Colonel, Washington led 140 men to the Forks of the Ohio, where a smaller English group had been chased away by a superior French force. Upon hearing of a French diplomatic mission sent to parley, Washington, unaware of their peaceful intent, ambushed the party, killing ten Frenchmen including Ensign Joseph de Jumonville. This incident provoked a French military response. Subsequently, during the Braddock Expedition, Washington served alongside British regulars under General Braddock. Despite Washington's advice to dispense with wagons for faster movement through the unblazed wilderness, Braddock refused. The British forces became dispersed and were ambushed by French and Indian forces near the Monongahela River. Washington played a significant role in the battle, as many British officers were wounded or killed, and colonial troops faced friendly fire from British soldiers who mistook them for the enemy.

In late November 1758, the French, believing the British would not strike until spring, evacuated Fort Duquesne after destroying their cannon. Washington and his vanguard marched in on November 25, 1758, and raised the British flag on the ruins, renaming it Fort Pitt. This event concluded five years of conflict to secure the Forks of the Ohio, with peace established between the British and local Indian tribes. George Washington played a key role by leading his troops to occupy the fort and later viewing the transformation of the French fort into Fort Pitt on Christmas morning 1758. His leadership during this campaign and subsequent decision to resign and return to Mount Vernon in early 1759 marked the end of his military service in the war and the beginning of his life as a landowner and public figure.']",0.9999999999666667,0.5384615384615384,0.9380040515222653,0.3333333333333333,0.41092821366031973,0.9513663293984483
