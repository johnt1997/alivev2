He then continued alone to report back to the Colonial government in Williamsburg, producing a detailed 7000-word report and map of French forts along the upper Ohio River. This report highlighted French activities and their goal of occupying the Ohio Valley west of the English Colonies, drawing considerable attention and placing Washington in a position of notoriety on both sides of the Atlantic. Later, in April 1754, as a newly promoted Lieutenant Colonel, Washington led 140 men to the Forks of the Ohio, where a smaller English group had been chased away by a superior French force. Upon hearing of a French diplomatic mission sent to parley, Washington, unaware of their peaceful intent, ambushed the party, killing ten Frenchmen including Ensign Joseph de Jumonville. This incident provoked a French military response. Subsequently, during the Braddock Expedition, Washington served alongside British regulars under General Braddock. Despite Washington's advice to dispense with wagons for faster movement through the unblazed wilderness, Braddock refused. The British forces became dispersed and were ambushed by French and Indian forces near the Monongahela River.

One of their most significant contributions was through military reforms. Recognizing the need for a more organized and disciplined force, Congress worked tirelessly to implement changes that would help achieve this goal. For instance, Congress established a Committee of Secret Correspondence in 1776, which was responsible for coordinating military operations and gathering intelligence. This committee played a vital role in organizing the Continental Army and ensuring that it was able to operate effectively against the British.

Furthermore, Congress recognized the importance of spiritual support for soldiers and worked to ensure that the Continental Army had access to qualified chaplains who could provide spiritual guidance and support to soldiers. This was particularly crucial during times of battle when soldiers were under great stress and needed spiritual support.
