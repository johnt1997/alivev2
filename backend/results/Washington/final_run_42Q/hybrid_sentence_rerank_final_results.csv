In April 1754, as a newly promoted Lieutenant Colonel, Washington led 140 men to the Forks of the Ohio, where a smaller English group had been chased away by a superior French force. Washington cut a road to the Ohio Company’s storehouse and ambushed a French diplomatic mission led by Ensign Joseph de Jumonville, mistakenly assuming it was an attack party. This ambush resulted in the death of Jumonville and others, escalating tensions. Later, during the Braddock Expedition, Washington served alongside notable figures such as Daniel Boone and Horatio Gates. Despite his advice to General Braddock to dispense with wagons and adopt more flexible tactics, Braddock refused, leading to a disastrous ambush by French forces and their Indian allies near the Monongahela River. Washington played a significant role in the battle, surviving when many British officers were wounded or killed, and helping to rally the colonial troops.

In contrast, King George III's response to colonial complaints during the buildup to the American Revolution was marked by a more cautious approach. While he was still willing to negotiate with colonial leaders, he was more hesitant to take military action against them.

With Fort Lee under British control, my army was reduced to 5,400 troops and forced to retreat across the Hudson River to Fort Lee. This setback made it challenging for my troops to maintain their morale and discipline as they faced numerous obstacles during their retreat and crossing of the Delaware River.
