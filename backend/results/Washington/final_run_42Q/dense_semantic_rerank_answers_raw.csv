How did George Washington's early military leadership during the French and Indian War demonstrate his ability to manage diverse troops and respond to the French threat?,"Original Answer:  George Washington's early military leadership during the French and Indian War demonstrated his ability to manage diverse troops and respond to the French threat in several ways. First, he was able to rally a small band of outdoorsmen and a French interpreter to join him on his mission to confront the French. This shows his ability to lead and inspire others, even in difficult circumstances. Second, Washington was able to negotiate with local Iroquois Indians to guide him to a French trading post and then to Fort Le Boeuf. This demonstrates his diplomatic skills and ability to work with people from different backgrounds. Third, Washington's ambush of the French force at Jumonville Glen resulted in the death of their commander and set off a diplomatic nightmare. This shows his willingness to take risks and make bold decisions, even in the face of danger. Finally, Washington's successful defense of Fort Necessity against the French attack in July 1754 further demonstrated his ability to manage diverse troops and respond to the French threat. Overall, Washington's early military leadership during the French and Indian War showcased his leadership skills, diplomatic abilities, and willingness to take risks.","['. to drive \nthem off by force of arms.”5  \n \nJoined by a  small band of outdoorsmen and a French interpreter, Washington set off \ninto the Ohio wilderness, where he quickly became plagued by miserably cold weather \nand freezing rain. Nevertheless, he made contact with local Iroquois Indians, who guided \nWashington to a French trading post; from there, they made their way to the French Fort \nLe Boeuf, arriving at the fort (in present day northwest Pennsylvania) in mid -December. The French were not keen to obey Washington’s request that they leave, and Washington \nhurri edly returned to Williamsburg to report the news. Presenting Governor Dinwiddie \nwith the French reply, along with his own estimates of French military power and a \ndetailed journal of the expedition, Washington impressed his superiors with the diligence \nwith which he undertook the mission. His reports were soon published in newspapers \nacross the Colonies and in Great Britain, making the young George Washington instantly \nfamous —and setting the stage for the soon -to-come French and Indian War. A few months l ater, the now -Lieutenant Colonel Washington led about a hundred \nmilitiamen and a number of Mingo Iroquois warriors back into the wilderness, this time \nto confront the French.

"How did George Washington's early military career, including his ambush of the French diplomatic mission and his role in the Braddock Expedition, reflect the conflict between British and French forces in the Ohio Valley?","Original Answer: George Washington's early military career, including his ambush of the French diplomatic mission and his role in the Braddock Expedition, reflected the conflict between British and French forces in the Ohio Valley. In 1754, Washington led a small band of outdoorsmen and a French interpreter into the Ohio wilderness to make contact with local Iroquois Indians and request that the French leave. However, the French were not keen to obey Washington's request and Washington had to return to Williamsburg to report the news. In 1755, Washington volunteered as an aide to General Edward Braddock, who led a British expedition to expel the French from Fort Duquesne and the Ohio Country. During the Battle of the Monongahela, two-thirds of the British force became casualties and Braddock was killed. Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Gage, Washington rallied the survivors and formed a rear guard, allowing the remnants of the force to retreat.

why washington warn us about permanent foreign alliances and how he say we should keep neutrality in foreign policy in his farewell address?,"Original Answer:  George Washington warned against permanent foreign alliances in his Farewell Address because he believed that such alliances would be subversive of America's national interest. He believed that the stability of the Republic was threatened by the forces of geographical sectionalism, political factionalism, and interference by foreign powers in the nation's domestic affairs. Washington urged Americans to subordinate sectional jealousies to common national interests and to steer clear of permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world. He believed that neutrality in foreign policy was the best course for America to pursue, as it would allow the country to focus on its own development and prosperity without being entangled in the conflicts and rivalries of other nations.","['The Lansdowne portrait (1796)Washington stressed that national identity was paramount, and said that the ""nam e of AMERICAN... must\nalways exalt the just pride of patriotism"".[226] Washington warned against the dangers of political parties\nand entangling foreign alliances with domestic affairs.[227] He counseled friendship and commerce  with\nall nations, but advised against involvement in European wars.[228] He stressed the importance of\nreligion, asserting that ""religion and morality are indispensable supports"" in a republic.[229]\nHe closed the address by reflecting on his legacy: ""I fervently beseech the Almighty to avert or mitigate\nthe evils to which [my unintentioned errors] may tend. I shall also carry with me the hope that my country\nwill never cease to view them with indulgence, and that, after forty-five years of my life dedicated to its\nservice with an upright zeal, the faults of incompetent abilities will be consigned to oblivion, as myself\nmust soon be to the mansions of rest.""[230] After initial publication, many Repu blicans, including\nMadison, criticized the address and described it as an anti-French campaign document, with Madison\nbelieving that Washington was strongly pro-British.[231] In 1972, the Washington scholar James Flexner\nreferred to the Farewell Address as receiving as much acclaim as Thomas Jefferson\'s Declaration of\nIndependence  and Abraham Lincoln \'s Gettysbur g Address .[232] In 2010, Chernow called the ""Farewell\nAddress"" one of the most influential statements on republicanism .[233]\nWashington retired to Mount Vernon in March 1797 and\ndevoted time to his business interests.[234] His plantation\noperations were minimally profitable,[33] and his lands in the\nwest (on the Piedmont ) yielded little income; he attempted to\nsell these but was unable to.[235] He became an even more\ncommitted Federalist.

With the assistance of Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, Washington composed in a “Farewell Address” his political testament to the nation. Designed to inspire and guide future genera-tions, the address also set forth Washington’s defense of his administra-tion’s record and embodied a classic statement of Federalist doctrine. Washington’s principal concern was for the safety of the eight-year-\nold Constitution. He believed that the stability of the Republic was threatened by the forces of geographical sectionalism, political faction-alism, and interference by foreign powers in the nation’s domestic af-fairs. He urged Americans to subordinate sectional jealousies to com-mon national interests. Writing at a time before political parties had become accepted as vital extraconstitutional, opinion-focusing agen-cies, Washington feared that they carried the seeds of the nation’s de-struction through petty factionalism. Although Washington was in nosense the father of American isolationism, since he recognized the ne-cessity of temporary associations for “extraordinary emergencies,” he did counsel against the establishment of “permanent alliances with other countries,” connections that he warned would inevitably be sub-versive of America’s national interest. Washington did not publicly deliver his Farewell Address. It first ap-\npeared on September 19, 1796, in the Philadelphia \nDaily American \nAdvertiser and then in papers around the country. In January 1862, with the Constitution endangered by civil war, a thou-\nsand citizens of Philadelphia petitioned Congress to commemorate theforthcoming 130th anniversary of George Washington ’s birth by provid-\ning that “the Farewell Address of Washington be read aloud on the morn-\ning of that day in one or the other of the Houses of Congress. ” Both \nhouses agreed and assembled in the House of Representatives ’ chamber \non February 22, 1862, where Secretary of the Senate John W. Forney “ren-\ndered ‘The Farewell Address ’ very effectively, ” as one observer recalled. The practice of reading the Farewell Address did not immediately be-\ncome a tradition. The address was first read in regular legislative ses-sions of the Senate in 1888 and the House in 1899. (The House continuedthe practice until 1984.) Since 1893 the Senate has observed Washington ’s birthday by selecting one of its members to read the \nFarewell Address. The assignment alternates between members of each political party. At the conclusion of each reading, the appointed sena-tor inscribes his or her name and brief remarks in a black, leather-bound book maintained by the secretary of the Senate. The version of the address printed here is taken from the original of \nthe final manuscript in the New York Public Library provided courtesy of The Papers of George Washington. The only changes have been to modernize spelling, capitalization, and punctuation.']",True,10,3,3,3,3.6108603477478027,0.39705729484558105,multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer,0,0
"How did George Washington's 1754 expedition to the Ohio Valley, including the conflict with French forces and the construction of Fort Necessity, influence his military rank and subsequent role in the French and Indian War, considering Governor Dinwiddie's mission and the political ramifications of Jumonville's death?","Original Answer: George Washington's 1754 expedition to the Ohio Valley, including the conflict with French forces and the construction of Fort Necessity, had a significant impact on his military rank and subsequent role in the French and Indian War. Although Governor Dinwiddie's mission was primarily to demand that the French vacate land claimed by the British, Washington's actions during this expedition helped him gain recognition as a capable military leader.

Washington's successful ambush of the French force at Great Meadows, which resulted in the death of Joseph Coulon de Jumonville and other French soldiers, raised his profile both in the Colonies and abroad. This achievement, along with his subsequent construction of Fort Necessity, demonstrated his ability to lead troops in difficult conditions and to make strategic decisions under pressure.

However, the political ramifications of Jumonville's death were also significant. The French saw Washington's actions as an act of aggression and responded by attacking Fort Necessity. While Washington was ultimately able to negotiate a peaceful resolution with the French, the incident highlighted the tensions between the British and French forces in the Ohio River Valley and set the","['. to drive \nthem off by force of arms.”5  \n \nJoined by a  small band of outdoorsmen and a French interpreter, Washington set off \ninto the Ohio wilderness, where he quickly became plagued by miserably cold weather \nand freezing rain.

He had to organize and lead a poorly organized and equipped force against disciplined British troops, which required him to implement army reforms and discipline measures.

Firstly, Washington's mission was unsuccessful as the French refused to vacate the land claimed by the British, which led to an increase in tensions between the two sides. Additionally, Washington's diplomatic efforts were met with hostility from the Iroquois, who saw the British as a threat to their way of life. This further complicated the situation and made it more difficult for the British to maintain control over the region.

"How did George Washington's early military career, including his ambush of the French diplomatic mission and his role in the Braddock Expedition, reflect the conflict between British and French forces during the mid-18th century?","Original Answer:  George Washington's early military career, including his ambush of the French diplomatic mission and his role in the Braddock Expedition, reflected the conflict between British and French forces during the mid-18th century. In 1754, tensions between the two powers had escalated into an all-out war, with the British seeking to expand their territory in North America and the French determined to defend their holdings in Canada. Washington's ambush of the French diplomatic mission, which resulted in the death of one French soldier and the capture of several others, was a significant event in the early stages of the conflict.

With the assistance of Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, Washington composed in a “Farewell Address” his political testament to the nation. Designed to inspire and guide future genera-tions, the address also set forth Washington’s defense of his administra-tion’s record and embodied a classic statement of Federalist doctrine. Washington’s principal concern was for the safety of the eight-year-\nold Constitution. He believed that the stability of the Republic was threatened by the forces of geographical sectionalism, political faction-alism, and interference by foreign powers in the nation’s domestic af-fairs. He urged Americans to subordinate sectional jealousies to com-mon national interests. Writing at a time before political parties had become accepted as vital extraconstitutional, opinion-focusing agen-cies, Washington feared that they carried the seeds of the nation’s de-struction through petty factionalism. Although Washington was in nosense the father of American isolationism, since he recognized the ne-cessity of temporary associations for “extraordinary emergencies,” he did counsel against the establishment of “permanent alliances with other countries,” connections that he warned would inevitably be sub-versive of America’s national interest. Washington did not publicly deliver his Farewell Address. It first ap-\npeared on September 19, 1796, in the Philadelphia \nDaily American \nAdvertiser and then in papers around the country. In January 1862, with the Constitution endangered by civil war, a thou-\nsand citizens of Philadelphia petitioned Congress to commemorate theforthcoming 130th anniversary of George Washington ’s birth by provid-\ning that “the Farewell Address of Washington be read aloud on the morn-\ning of that day in one or the other of the Houses of Congress. ” Both \nhouses agreed and assembled in the House of Representatives ’ chamber \non February 22, 1862, where Secretary of the Senate John W. Forney “ren-\ndered ‘The Farewell Address ’ very effectively, ” as one observer recalled. The practice of reading the Farewell Address did not immediately be-\ncome a tradition. The address was first read in regular legislative ses-sions of the Senate in 1888 and the House in 1899. (The House continuedthe practice until 1984.) Since 1893 the Senate has observed Washington ’s birthday by selecting one of its members to read the \nFarewell Address. The assignment alternates between members of each political party.

"How did the events at White Plains influence the capture and exposure of Benedict Arnold's plot involving John André, and what role did the communication between the officers play in this outcome?","Original Answer: The events at White Plains did not directly influence the capture and exposure of Benedict Arnold's plot involving John André. However, the communication between the officers played a significant role in this outcome.

"How did the capture of Forts Lee and Washington by the British impact General Washington's strategic movements in New Jersey, and what challenges did his troops face during the subsequent retreat and crossing of the Delaware River, considering the themes of Fort Lee and Forts Lee?","Original Answer: The capture of Forts Lee and Washington by the British had a significant impact on General Washington's strategic movements in New Jersey. After the fall of Fort Washington, Washington's army was reduced to 5,400 troops, and his future as commander of the Continental Army was uncertain due to a lack of supplies, harsh winter conditions, expiring enlistments, and desertions. However, Washington heeded the advice of General Greene to defend Fort Lee, which was ultimately unsuccessful.

During the subsequent retreat across the Hudson River into Pennsylvania, Washington's troops faced numerous challenges. They were pursued by the British regulars and had to cross the Delaware River in the dead of winter, facing harsh weather conditions and the possibility of being trapped on the ice. Additionally, the capture of Fort Lee and Washington by the British led to a rumor that Washington had set fire to New York City, which further complicated his strategic movements in the region.

Despite these challenges, Washington's victories at Trenton and Princeton were pivotal in reviving Patriot morale and quashing the British strategy of showing overwhelming force followed by offering generous terms.

"How did the Continental Congress influence the organization and discipline of the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War, particularly in relation to military reforms and the appointment of chaplains, and what challenges did General Washington face in enforcing these measures?","Original Answer: The Continental Congress played a significant role in the organization and discipline of the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War. In July 1775, the Continental Congress created the Continental Army and appointed General George Washington as its commander-in-chief. The Continental Congress also established articles of war for the government of the army, which required strict discipline and prohibited profane cursing, swearing, and drunkenness. Additionally, the Continental Congress required officers to pay attention to keeping their men neat and clean, and to provide straw for them if possible.

One of the challenges that General Washington faced in enforcing these measures was the lack of discipline among some of the soldiers. The Continental Army was made up of troops from various colonies, each with their own customs and traditions. This made it difficult to establish a uniform standard of behavior and discipline. Additionally, the Continental Congress did not have the resources or authority to enforce its orders consistently across the entire army.

Despite these challenges, General Washington was able to maintain a high level of discipline and order within the Continental Army. He worked closely with his staff officers to establish clear lines of command and to ensure that all soldiers understood","['General Washington, Commander of the\nContinental Army, a 1776 portrait by\nCharles Willson Pealecombined with low tobacco prices left him £1,800 in debt by 1764.[54] Washington\'s complete reliance on\nLondon tobacco buyer and merchant Robert Cary also threatened his economic security .[e][56] Between\n1764 and 1766, he sought to diversify his holdings: he changed Mount Vernon\'s primary cash crop from\ntobacco to wheat and expanded operati ons to include flour milling  and hemp farming .[57] Washington\'s\nstepdaughter Patsy suffered from epileptic  attacks, and she died at Mount Vernon in 1773, allowing\nWashington to use part of the inheritance from her estate to settle his debts.[58]\nWashington was opposed to the taxes which the British Parliament  imposed on the Colonies without\nproper representation .[59] He believed the Stamp Act 1765  was oppressive and celebrated its repeal the\nfollowing year.

How did Colonel William Fairfax influence George Washington's early surveying career and his connection to the Fairfax family?,"Original Answer: Colonel William Fairfax influenced George Washington's early surveying career and his connection to the Fairfax family by inviting him to visit Belvoir, the Fairfax estate not far from Mount Vernon. During these visits, Fairfax taught Washington how to navigate the world of the upper gentry and took him on fox hunts. Additionally, Fairfax provided Washington with a valuable opportunity to survey much of the Northern Neck Proprietary, which the Fairfax family had received from King Charles II in 1649. This surveying trip took Washington into the Shenandoah Valley, and it was here that he first became accustomed to life in the wild while simultaneously seeking to fit into polite society back home.","[' \n Page | 2 Instead, George learned lessons that w ould benefit him practically as a farmer and \nlandowner: math, geometry, surveying, law (e.g., leases, bonds, and patents) and basic \neconomics (interest, currency conversions, etc.).

Lawrence’s marriage into the family \nquickly elevated him into the higher social class, and he soon won election to the Virginia \nHouse of Burgesses. Lawr ence regularly invited George to visit him at Belvoir, the \nFairfax estate not far from Mount Vernon, and soon George won the approval of the \nColonel himself, who took him on fox hunts (George was, even at a young age, already \nnoted for his riding ability) and taught him to navigate the world of the upper gentry.4  \n \nIn 1746, at the age of 16, Washington set out with George William Fairfax (Colonel \nFairfax’s son) to survey much of the Northern Neck Proprietary, which the Fairfax family \nhad received from King Charles II in 1649.

"How did Washington's leadership and strategy, as described in the abandoned American fortifications and his ability to inspire troops during difficult times, combined with the support from women and African Americans, contribute to the American forces' ability to avoid total defeat and sustain their fight during the Revolutionary War?","Original Answer: Washington's leadership and strategy, as described in the abandoned American fortifications and his ability to inspire troops during difficult times, combined with the support from women and African Americans, contributed to the American forces' ability to avoid total defeat and sustain their fight during the Revolutionary War by allowing them to keep moving around and prevent a total defeat. The untrained American troops were no match for the experienced British army head-on in a battle, so Washington's strategy was to keep the Continental Army moving and fighting now and then, but not getting into a major battle. This allowed him to buy time to build and train his army. Additionally, the support from women and African Americans provided important sources of help for the Patriot side, including supplies and manpower. The ability to keep moving around also made it difficult for the British to completely defeat the American forces, as they could always prevent a total defeat by moving out of one square to let the British come in.

"How did John Jay contribute as one of America’s negotiators in the Treaty of Paris, and what role did his family background, including his grandfather Lawrence Washington, play in shaping his early life?","Original Answer: John Jay contributed as one of America's negotiators in the Treaty of Paris by formulating the Jay Treaty, which aimed to normalize trade relations with Britain while removing them from western forts and resolving financial debts remaining from the Revolution. As a signatory of the treaty, he represented Washington's position and played a crucial role in securing ratification despite frequent public criticism and political controversy.

How did the strategic importance of Bunker Hill and the heavy British losses during the battle contribute to the colonists' growing confidence in their ability to stand against the British army?,"Original Answer: The strategic importance of Bunker Hill and the heavy British losses during the battle contributed to the colonists' growing confidence in their ability to stand against the British army by demonstrating that they were capable of holding their own against one of the world's greatest armies. The Battle of Bunker Hill was a turning point for the colonists, as it showed them that they could not be easily defeated and that they had the courage and determination to fight for their rights. Additionally, the British losses during the battle were significant, as more than a thousand soldiers were killed or wounded, which weakened the British army's morale and strength. This gave the colonists hope that they could eventually win the war and gain their independence.","['Bunker Hill proved to be a very costly victory for the British. 87The British won the hill but at a terrible cost. More than a thousand \nsoldiers were killed or wounded. Just as during their march back from Concord, the British lost about half their men. A British officer said that his army couldn’t stand many more “victories” like this. Even though the battle took place on Breed’s Hill, it is known as the \nBattle of Bunker Hill. The Battle of Bunker Hill was very important to the colonists. They lost the hill, but they won new confidence. They were beginning to believe these citizen-soldiers could hold their own against one of the world’s greatest armies—the British army. Soon after, the colonists learned King George III’s answer to their \npetition. He had no intention of backing down.', 'They did not bother to guard the two hills. On the night of June\xa016,\xa01775, the militia suddenly marched to Breed’s Hill and \nclimbed it. They were supposed to take up positions on Bunker \nHill, but moved onto the wrong hill. All night they dug trenches , piling the \nearth into walls six feet high for their \nprotection. When the morning came, the British were surprised to see the colonial \nmilitia in control of the hill. General Gage was now worried that the militia would be able to \nfire on his troops below. They could even use cannons to fire upon the British ships in the harbor. Gage needed to drive the militia off the hill. Gage didn’t know that the Massachusetts militia didn’t have any\xa0cannons. The next day, British soldiers marched up Breed’s Hill. The colonists \nhad only a small amount of ammunition . They couldn’t afford to \nwaste any. They stood shoulder to shoulder behind their earthen walls. When the British got close, the militiamen opened fire. Hundreds of redcoats fell. The rest fled back down the hill. Once more the British marched up the hill. Once more they \nwere driven back by a hail of bullets. After the second charge, the colonists began to run out of ammunition. When the British marched up the hill a third time, the militia retreated.Vocabulary\ntrench,  n. a narrow \nditch dug into the \nground\nammunition,  n.', ""67 \n CHAPTER VIII.

"How did the capture and renaming of Fort Duquesne to Fort Pitt mark a turning point in the French and Indian War, and what role did George Washington play in this transition?","Original Answer: The capture and renaming of Fort Duquesne to Fort Pitt marked a turning point in the French and Indian War because it prevented the French from using two important rivers for supply. This was one of George Washington's early military successes, and it helped to establish his reputation as a capable leader. However, Washington also made mistakes during this campaign, such as not having enough men to drive the French out of the fort. Despite these challenges, Washington was able to learn from his experiences and become a great general in the future.","['36meant sending more soldiers to North America, Pitt would do it. Waging a war on many continents was expensive, but Pitt was ready to spend whatever was necessary to win. Pitt wanted to win control of two rivers: the St. Lawrence River and \nthe Niagara River. The French used these rivers to send supplies to their soldiers near the Great Lakes and in the Ohio River Valley, including those at Fort Duquesne. If the British could prevent the French from using these rivers, they would soon run out of supplies. Aided by their Native American allies and the American colonists, \nthe British did what Pitt wanted. In addition, British and American \nforces captured Fort Duquesne. They renamed it Fort Pitt. That is how the city of Pittsburgh eventually got its name. They also captured the French fortress at Louisbourg in Canada. Another part of Pitt’s plan was to capture Quebec. The city of Quebec \nsits atop steep cliffs alongside the St. Lawrence River. The cliffs \nprotected the city from attack.', 'George Washington was proud to be an officer in the \nVirginia militia. 29this, Virginia would \nhave more control of the Ohio River and the smaller rivers that \nflowed from and fed \ninto the larger river. One year later, in 1754, he sent George Washington to the west again. This time Washington led a force \nof 150 men. The British had built a \nsmall fort in western Pennsylvania on the site of present-day Pittsburgh. The fort sat where two rivers come together to form \nthe Ohio River. Washington was to join forces with the British \nsoldiers at the fort. Before he arrived, Washington learned that the French had already captured the British fort and renamed it Fort Duquesne (/doo*kayn/). In time, George Washington would \nbecome a great general , but in 1754, he \nwas young and inexperienced. He made a number of mistakes. Washington did not have enough men to drive the French out of the fort. The wisest thing to do would have been to return to Virginia. Instead, he continued on with his small force.', 'Washington was\nreinvigorated, however , when Lafayette  returned from France\nwith more ships, men, and supplies,[133] and 5,000 veteran\nFrench troops led by Marshal Rochambeau  arrived at\nNewport, Rhode Island  in July .[134]\nGeneral Clinton sent Arnold, now a British brigadier general,\nto Virginia in December with 1,700 troops to capture\nPortsmouth  and conduct raids on Patriot forces. Washington\nsent Lafayette south to counter Arnold\'s efforts.[135]\nWashington initially hoped to bring the fight to New York,\ndrawing the British forces away from Virginia and ending the\nwar there, but Rochambeau advised him that Cornwallis  in\nVirginia was the better target.[136] On August 19, 1781, Washington and Rochambeau began a march to\nYorktown, Virginia , known now as the ""celebrated march "".[137] Washington was in command of an army\nof 7,800 Frenchmen, 3,100 militia, and 8,000 Continental troops. Inexperienced  in siege warfare, he often\ndeferred to the judgment of Rochambeau. Despite this, Rochambeau never challenged Washington\'s\nauthority as the battle\'s commanding of ficer.[138]\nBy late September , Patriot-French forces surrounded Yorktown, trapping the British Army , while the\nFrench navy emer ged victorious at the Battle of the Chesapeake . The final American offensive began with\na shot fired by Washington.[124] The siege ended with a British surrender on October 19, 1781; over\n7,000 British soldiers became prisoners of war.[139] Washington negotiated the terms of surrender for two\ndays, and the official signing ceremony took place on October 19.[140] Although the peace treaty was not\nnegotiated for two more years, Yorktown proved to be the last significant battle of the Revolutionary War,\nwith the British Parliament agreeing to cease hostilities in March 1782.[141]\nWhen peace negotiations began in April 1782, both the British and French began gradually evacuating\ntheir forces.[142] In March 1783, Washington successfu lly calmed the Newbur gh Conspiracy , a planned\nmutiny by American officers dissatisfied with a lack of pay.[31][143] Washington submitted an account ofSouthern theater and Yorktown\nDemobilization and resignation']",True,10,3,3,3,3.403470516204834,0.474109023809433,multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer,0,0
