The Second Continental Congress and the Declaration of Independence \nThe Second Continental Congress met inside Independence Hall beginning in May 1775. It was just a \nmonth after shots had been fired at Lexington and Concord in Massachusetts, and the Congress was \npreparing for war. They established a Continental army and elected George Washington as Commander-\nin-Chief, but the delegates also drafted the Olive Branch Petition and sent it to King George III in hopes \nof reaching a peaceful resolution. The king refused to hear the petition and declared the American \ncolonies in revolt. On June 7, 1776, Virginia delegate Richard Henry Lee put forth the resolution for independence:  \n“Resolved, that these united colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent states…”  \nVoting was postponed while some of the delegates worked to convince others to support \nindependence, but a committee of five men was assigned to draft a document of independence: John \nAdams (MA), Benjamin Franklin (PA), Thomas Jefferson (VA), Roger Sherman (CT), and Robert R. Livingston (NY)."}

This is the day that John Adams thought should be celebrated with “Pomp and Parade, with Shews, \nGames, Sports, Guns, Bells, Bonfires and Illuminations from one End of this Continent to the other from \nthis Time forward forever more.” (John Adams to Abigail Adams, July 3, 1776) \nBetween July 2 and July 4, Congress argued over every word in Jefferson’s draft of the declaration, \nmaking numerous changes. On July 4, Congress voted again – this time to approve the wording of the \nDeclaration of Independence."}
{"id": "./data/Washington/American-Revolution-Overview-v2.pdf", "contents": "They didn’t actually sign the document that day. After New York’s \ndelegates received instructions from home to vote for independence (they had initially abstained), the \ndocument was sent to Timothy Matlack to be engrossed (handwritten). Fifty of the 56 men signed the \nengrossed Declaration of Independence inside Independence Hall on August 2, 1776. The Declaration of Independence as an Argument \nLooking back on the Declaration of Independence almost 50 years later, Thomas Jefferson explained \nthat the document’s purpose was never meant to be thoroughly original; its purpose wasn’t to articulate \nanything that hadn’t be said before, but to make the case for the American colonies in plain terms and \npersuade the world to see common sense. “It was intended to be an expression of the American mind,” \nJefferson explains. He goes on to claim that “[the Declaration’s] authority rests then on the harmonizing \nsentiments of the day.” (Jefferson to Henry Lee, May 8, 1825)  \nJefferson finished his timeless defense of “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness” in little more than \ntwo weeks, and like most writers, he was no stranger to the revision process. Between the Committee of \nFive and the Second Continental Congress, there were 86 edits to the document. The Second \nContinental Congress removed whole sections. Jefferson was most angered by the removal of one \nparticular clause, a clause blaming the King for forcing the slave trade upon the American colonies. The final draft of the Declaration of Independence contains a preamble, a list of grievances, a formal \ndeclaration of independence, and signatures. Preamble \nThis first of the Declaration contains an assertion of individual rights. Perhaps the most famous line \nstates, “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed \nby their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of \nHappiness.”  This part goes on to say that if the government tries to take these rights away, the people \nhave the right to form a new government. Jefferson also addresses a counterclaim in this section, \nacknowledging that “Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be \nchanged for light and transient causes…” He counters by reminding his audience of the “long train of \nabuses and usurpations” that makes it “…their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and \nto provide new Guards for their future security.” \nGrievances \nThe longest part of the Declaration lists the unfair actions of the British king and Parliament. In their \ncomplaints, the colonists make it clear that they are angry with the British king and government for \ntaking away their rights as English citizens. They point out that the king has ignored or changed their \ncolonial governments, as well as their rights to a trial by jury. The colonists accuse the king of sending a \nhired army to force them to obey unjust laws. They say the king is “unfit to be the ruler of a free \npeople.”"}
{"id": "./data/Washington/American-Revolution-Overview-v2.pdf", "contents": "3 \n \nNote: Because the norms and structure of argumentative writing in the 18th century were different than \nthey are in the 21st century, students might be confused about why the Declaration does not use the \nkind of evidence they are required to present in an essay (statistics, citations, etc). After all, the list of \ngrievances that serves as the Declaration’s evidence seems largely anecdotal by today’s standards. To \nminimize confusion, we recommend focusing on the Declaration’s claim and underlying assumption (big \nidea), which are especially applicable to the writing standards of 21st-century classrooms. Formal declaration of independence \nThis part affirms that the 13 colonies are free and independent states. It breaks all ties with the British \ngovernment and people. As independent states, they can make trade agreements and treaties, wage \nwar, and do whatever is necessary to govern themselves."}
{"id": "./data/Washington/American-Revolution-Overview-v2.pdf", "contents": "This formal declaration of independence ends \nwith important words. The words tell us what the signers of the Declaration of Independence were \nwilling to give up for freedom: “…we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our \nsacred Honor.” \nSignatures \nThere are 56 signatures on the Declaration of Independence. Fifty men from 13 states signed the \ndocument on August 2 in 1776. The other six signed over the course of the next year and a half. As the \nPresident of the Second Continental Congress, John Hancock signed first. He wrote his name very large. Some of the men abbreviated their first names, like Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin. All of the \nsigners risked their lives when they signed the Declaration of Independence. Legacy of the Argument \nContrary to popular belief, the words of the Declaration of Independence did not gain immediate \nprominence. In fact, they remained obscure for decades. And yet the spirit of the Declaration caused \nripples almost immediately, most famously with the French Revolution in 1789. The Haitian Revolution \nfollowed soon after, and the subsequent decades would see many Latin American countries continuing \nthe fight for independence from colonial powers. Within the U.S., the women’s suffrage movement adapted the Declaration of Independence for their \ncause, asserting in the 1848 Declaration of Sentiments that “all men and women are created equal.” \nMeanwhile, the country’s celebrations of independence haunted enslaved people and abolitionists like \nFrederick Douglass, whose 1852 speech “What to the Slave is the Fourth of July?” pondered the nation’s \nshortcoming despite its dedication to values like liberty. As Douglass said, “This Fourth of July is yours, \nnot mine. You may rejoice, I must mourn.” \nQuotes from the Founders about the Declaration \nThomas Jefferson to Henry Lee, 8 May 1825 (abridged) \n “When forced, therefore, to resort to arms for redress, an appeal to the tribunal of the world was \ndeemed proper for our justification. This was the object of the Declaration of Independence."}

W. Abbot1 \n \nEarly Life  \n \nAmerica’s first president was born on February 22, 1732 2 to Augustine Washington \n(1694–1743) and his se cond wife, Mary Ball Washington (1708 –89), at their family \nplantation at Popes Creek, Westmoreland County, Virginia. Together with his four \nsiblings (Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustine, and Charles; a fifth, Mildred, died as an \ninfant), George spent much of  his childhood on the move with his family. (George also \nhad three stepsiblings from his father’s previous marriage: Lawrence and Augustine II —\nrespectively 14 and 12 years George’s senior —and Jane, who died when George was \ntwo.) When he was three, the fami ly relocated 60 miles upstream to their home at Little \nHunting Creek on the Potomac (later named Mount Vernon); three years later, they \nmoved once more, this time to a smaller plot of land on the Rappahannock River near \nFredericksburg that was close to an iron furnace George’s father was then managing. When Washington, at age 11, lost his father to a sudden illness, the family owned \nnearly 50 slaves and 10,000 acres of land, planting the family firmly in the landed gentry \nof Virginia —though by no means ne ar the top of that class. George’s inheritance \nincluded, among other things, the family plot near Fredericksburg and its ten slaves. With \nhis father’s death also came the news that he would not be able to attend the classical \nAppleby School in England as h is stepbrothers had. This lack of a liberal education was \nmuch regretted by Washington as an adult, who would later write that “future years \ncannot compensate for lost days at this period” of one’s educational life.3 \n \n                                                 \n1 W.

With an intense desire to improve \nhimself, the teenage Washington regularl y mined books for their maxims to live by; he \nfamously copied out all 110 “Rules of Civility & Decent Behaviour in Company and \nConversation.”  \n \nAt the same time, George regularly visited his older stepbrother Lawrence, who had \ninherited Mount Vernon and, s hortly after his father’s death, married Ann Fairfax, \ndaughter of the powerful Colonel William Fairfax. Lawrence’s marriage into the family \nquickly elevated him into the higher social class, and he soon won election to the Virginia \nHouse of Burgesses. Lawr ence regularly invited George to visit him at Belvoir, the \nFairfax estate not far from Mount Vernon, and soon George won the approval of the \nColonel himself, who took him on fox hunts (George was, even at a young age, already \nnoted for his riding ability) and taught him to navigate the world of the upper gentry.4  \n \nIn 1746, at the age of 16, Washington set out with George William Fairfax (Colonel \nFairfax’s son) to survey much of the Northern Neck Proprietary, which the Fairfax family \nhad received from King Charles II in 1649. The surveying trip took Washington into the \nShenandoah Valley, and it was here that he first became accustomed to life in the wild —\neven as he simultaneously sought to fit into polite society back home. For the next several \nyears, George worked as a surveyor for the Fairfax family, and by the time he turned 21 \nhad accumulated nearly 2,500 acres of his own in the Shenandoah Valley. Early Military Career \n \nIn 1752, Lawrence Washington died of tuberculosis, leaving his seat as an adjutant \ngeneral of the Virginia militia vacant. George, inspired by his stepbrother’s example and \nwith a handful of influential patrons who would vouch for him, applied for the position \ndespite his lack of military experience. In February 1753, just before his 21st  birthday, he \nreceived the appointment as district adjutant for the Northern Neck of Virginia, becoming \na major in the Virginia militia. At six -feet-tall and a muscular 180 pounds, he looked the \npart."}

Nevertheless, he made contact with local Iroquois Indians, who guided \nWashington to a French trading post; from there, they made their way to the French Fort \nLe Boeuf, arriving at the fort (in present day northwest Pennsylvania) in mid -December. The French were not keen to obey Washington’s request that they leave, and Washington \nhurriedly returned to Williamsburg to report the news. Presenting Governor Dinwiddie \nwith the French reply, along with his own estimates of French military power and a \ndetailed journal of the expedition, Washington impressed his superiors with the diligence \nwith which he undertook the mission. His reports were soon published in newspapers \nacross the Colonies and in Great Britain, making the young George Washington instantly \nfamous—and setting the stage for the soon-to-come French and Indian War. A few months l ater, the now -Lieutenant Colonel Washington led about a hundred \nmilitiamen and a number of Mingo Iroquois warriors back into the wilderness, this time \nto confront the French. In an ambush by Washington against a French force of about 35 \nmen, a French envoy, Joseph Coulon de Villiers de Jumonville, who carried a message to \nthe British, was killed, setting off a diplomatic nightmare. (Washington claimed that the \nFrench were spying on his party and preparing to launch their own ambush.) Aware that \nthe French w ould retaliate, Washington swiftly began constructing defenses, which he \nlabeled Fort Necessity.

Madison told him that his absence would allow the\ndangerous political rift in his cabinet and the House to\nworsen. Jefferson also pleaded with him not to retire,\npledging to drop his attacks on Hamilton.[200] Hamilton\nmaintained that Washington's absence would be \"deplored as\nthe greatest evil\" to the country.[201] With the election of 1792\nnearing, Washington agreed to run.[202] On February 13,\n1793, the Electoral College unanimously re-elected\nWashington president, while John Adams was re-elected as\nvice president by a vote of 77 to 50.[202] Washington was sworn into office by Associate Justice William\nCushing on March 4, 1793, in Congress Hall in Philadelphia.[203]\nOn April 22, 1793, after the French Revolutionary Wars broke out, Washington issued a proclamation\ndeclaring American neutrality. He was resolved to pursue \"a conduct friendly and impartial toward the\nbelligerent Powers\" while warning Americans not to intervene in the conflict.[204] Although Washington\nrecognized France's revolutionary government, he eventually asked that the French minister to the United\nStates, Edmond-Charles Genêt, be recalled.[205] Genêt was a diplomatic troublemaker who was openly\nhostile toward Washington's neutrality policy.

Washington\nsupported the treaty because it avoided war,[210] although he was disappointed that its provisions favored\nBritain.[211] He mobilized public opinion and secured ratification[212] but faced frequent public criticism\nand political controversy.[213][31] Following the British abandonment of their forts around the Great\nLakes, the proposed position of the Canada–United States border was sent to arbitration. Numerous pre-\nRevolution debts were settled and the British opened the British West Indies to American merchants. The\nagreement secured peace with Britain and a decade of prosperous trade; however, Jefferson claimed that\nit angered France and \"invited rather than avoided\" war.[214] Jefferson's claim was verified when relations\nwith France deteriorated after the signing of the treaty, with the French Directory authorizing the seizure\nof American ships two days before Washington's term ended.[215] Succeeding president John Adams was\nleft with the prospect of war.[216] Relations with the Spanish were more successful: Thomas Pinckney\nnegotiated the Treaty of San Lorenzo in 1795, settling the border between the United States and Spanish\nterritory, and guaranteeing American navigational access to the Mississippi River[31][217]\nOn July 31, 1793, Jefferson submitted his resignation from cabinet.[218] Hamilton resigned from office in\nJanuary 1795 and was replaced by Oliver Wolcott Jr. Washington's relationship with Secretary of War\nHenry Knox deteriorated over rumors that Knox had profited from contracts for the construction of U.S."}

The Life story of a public man cannot help being to some extent the \nsame thing as a history of the times in which he lived, and to the \ncase of none does this remark apply with more force than to that of \nthe \"Father of his Country;\" which very title shows the degree to \nwhich the personality of its bearer became identified with the public \nlife of the nation. While a great deal of the space in this book, \nconsequently, has had to be devoted to American Revolutionary History, \nit is hoped that excess in this direction has been avoided, and that \nthe main purpose of the work will be attained, i.e. to give its young \nreaders a distinct and vivid idea of the exalted character and \npriceless services of Washington, so far as these can be brought \nwithin the understanding of a child."}

George Wash-ing-ton was born in the State of Vir-gin-i-a, at a place \nknown as Bridg-es Creek, on Feb-ru-a-ry 22, 1732. His great \ngrand-sire, John Wash-ing-ton, came from Eng-land in the year 1657, \nand took up lands in that state and was a rich man. George was the son \nof his grand-son Au-gus-tine. Au-gus-tine's first wife was Jane \nBut-ler who died and left him with two boys. His next wife was Ma-ry \nBall, and George was her first child. The old home-stead in which George was born stood near the banks of \nthe Po-to-mac Riv-er, and was built with a steep roof that sloped down \nto low eaves that hung out far from the main wall. There were four \nrooms on the ground floor, and some near the roof, and at each end of \nthe house was a great fire-place built of brick, with broad \nhearth-stones, such as were in style in those days. A stone is all that marks the birth-place of George Wash-ing-ton. He \nwas not more than eight years of age when his fa-ther went to live on"}

Law-rence Wash-ing-ton was sent when he was 15 years of age, and as he \nwas the first-born it was thought that he would in time take his \nfa-ther's place, as head of the house. The school to which George was sent stood in a field on his fa-ther's \nland, and was taught by a man named Hob-by. This gave it the name of \nthe \"Hob-by School.\" \n \nThere were but three things taught there: How to read--How to \nwrite--and How to do sums--and some folks thought that these were all \ntheir boys and girls had need to learn. Books were scarce and dear, \nand as most of the men raised fine crops, and kept up a brisk trade, \nthey were well pleased to have their boys learn how to buy and sell, \nand to make out bills. George had been trained by his fa-ther, who was \na strict and yet a just man, to love the truth and to do right at all \ntimes. He was made to feel that it was a sin to tell a lie, and much \nworse to hide a fault than to own it. George had a small axe of which he was quite proud, and boy-like, he \ncut right and left with it, and thought not of the harm he might do. On the lawn stood a small tree which his fa-ther hoped to see grow up"}

Who cut this tree?\" \n \nGeorge hung his head with shame. He knew he had done wrong; and he \nstood in fear of his fa-ther, who he knew would use the rod where \nthere was need of it."}

George raised his face, still red with the blush \nof shame, and said in his frank way, and with-out a sign of fear: \n \n\"I did it, fa-ther, I can-not tell a lie.\" \n \nThere was no need to use the rod on such a boy as that, and the \nfa-ther must have felt a thrill of joy when he found that the great \ntruths he had taught his son had such a hold on his mind and had \nstruck their roots deep in-to his heart. It is told that he clasped George to his breast, and said with tears \nin his eyes; that it would grieve him less to lose scores and scores \nof trees, than to have his boy tell one lie. But you must not think that George Wash-ing-ton was such a good-good \nboy that he could guide him-self, and did not need to be kept in \ncheck.

The task was one for which she was \nwell fit, as she had rare good sense, a fine mind, a strong will, and \na kind heart. She used to read to her boys and girls each day out of some good book, \ntalk with them, and tell them how they could best serve God and man, \nand George laid up each word in his heart, and sought to pay her back \nas well as he could for all her kind love and care. She said of George that he was \"a good boy;\" and it has been said in \nher praise that \"a no-ble mo-ther must have borne so brave a son.\" \n \nWhen George was 13 and his half-bro-ther Law-rence 21, Eng-land and \nSpain went to war, and Law-rence went with the troops that were sent \nto the West In-dies. The sight of Law-rence in war-like trim, the \nsound of drum and fife, and the march of troops through the streets, \nfired the heart of the young lad, and from that time his plays and \ngames, in school and out, took on a war-like turn. There was a boy at school, named Wil-li-am Bus-tle, who took up arms \nand marched with as much zeal as George Wash-ing-ton. But George was \nat all times com-mand-er-in-chief!"}

He was fond of a horse, and there was no steed so \nwild that George could not mount on his back and tame him. Mrs. Wash-ing-ton had a colt which she thought so much of that she let \nit run loose in the field. He was so fierce that no one had dared to \nget on his back. One day George went out to view the colt with some of his boy friends, \nand he told them that if they would help him put the bit in the \ncolt's mouth he would mount. The boys drove the colt in-to a small \nlot, put the bit in his mouth, and Wash-ing-ton was soon on his back. The beast rushed in-to the field, but was soon curbed by the strong \narms of the boy on his back. Then the colt reared and plunged and \ntried in all sorts of ways to get rid of the lad, who clung to the \ncolt's bare back as if he had been glued there. Mad with rage the colt \ntried once more to throw him, but strained too hard, and fell to the \nground and died in a short time.

A flush rose to the mo-ther's cheek, and then she said to her boy: \"It \nis well; but while I grieve at the loss of my fine colt, I feel a \npride and joy in my son, who speaks the truth at all times.\" \n \nGeorge was fond of his books too, and was so wise a lad, and so full \nof thought, and had so keen a sense of what was just, that his \nschool-mates came to him when they got in-to a war of words, or of \nblows, that he might say which side was right and which was wrong, and \nthus put an end to the fight. This use of his mind made George look at \nthings in a clear light, and gave him that look of true pride which \nall men of high mind, the real kings of earth, are wont to wear. In due time George out-grew the Hob-by School, and was sent to live \nwith his half-bro-ther Au-gus-tine, at Bridg-es Creek, where there was \na school of a high grade. But George had no taste for Lat-in or Greek, \nand liked best to do sums, and to draw maps."}

Some few of these I will give you, that you may see \nat how young an age this boy set out to train him-self, and fit \nhim-self for the high place he was to fill. It al-most seems as if he \nmust have known the high rank he was to take; but this could not be. His soul was fixed on high things; he had; no low tastes; and he was \nled by the hand of God. Here are some of the rules that George Wash-ing-ton took as the guide \nof his youth. \"In the pres-ence of o-thers sing not to your-self with a \n     hum-ming noise, nor drum with your fin-gers or feet. \"Sleep not when o-thers speak, sit not when o-thers stand, \n     speak not when you should hold your peace, walk not when \n     o-thers stop. \"Turn not your back to o-thers when speak-ing; jog not the \n     ta-ble or desk on which an-o-ther reads or writes; lean not \n     on a-ny one. \"Read no let-ters, books, or pa-pers in com-pa-ny; but when \n     there is a need for do-ing it, you must ask leave."}

George was a great pet with his bro-ther, Law-rence Wash-ing-ton, who \nthought it would be a nice thing for him to serve on board one of the \nKing's ships-of-war.

The \nplan had been thought out by George Wash-ing-ton when a boy of 16, and \nshows the cast of his mind. Near this time George was sent to live with his bro-ther Law-rence, at \nhis fine place on the Po-to-mac, which he had called Mount Ver-non, to \nshow how much he thought of the ad-mi-ral of that name. Here George had a chance to make friends with those of high rank, and \nhe spent much of his time with George Fair-fax who made his home at \nBel-voir, near Mount Ver-non. Lord Fair-fax, a man of wealth and \nworth was much at Bel-voir at that time. He had bought large tracts of \nland in Vir-gin-i-a, which had not been staked out, or set off in-to \nlots. In fact he did not know their size or shape, but he had heard \nthat men had sought out some of the best spots, and had built homes \nthere, and laid out farms for which they paid no rent, and he thought \nit quite time to put a stop to such things. In March, 1748, George Wash-ing-ton, who had been picked out by Lord \nFair-fax for this task, went on his first trip with George Fair-fax to \nstake off these wild lands. He wrote down what was done from day to \nday, and by these notes we learn that he had quite a rough time of it, \nand yet found much that was to his taste."}

The fleas and bugs soon forced George to get up and put on his clothes \nand lie as the rest of the men did, and \"had we not been so tired,\" he \nsays \"I am sure we should not have slept much that night.\" He made a \nvow then that he would sleep out of doors near a fire when on such \ntramps, and run no more such risks. On March 18, they reached a point on the Po-to-mac, which they were \ntold they could not ford. There had been a great rain-fall and the \nstream had not been so high, by six feet, as it was at that time. They \nmade up their minds to stay there for a day or two; went to see the \nWarm Springs, and at night camped out in the field. At the end of two \ndays, as the stream was still high, they swam their steeds to the \nMar-y-land side. The men crossed in birch-bark boats, and rode all the \nnext day in a rain storm to a place two-score miles from where they \nhad set out that morn.

Word was sent to the fort to have the men that \nwere there join them with all speed. They reached Gist's at dusk, and by dawn of the next day all our \ntroops were in that place, where it was at first thought they would \nwait for the foe. But this plan they gave up, for it was deemed best to make haste back \nto the fort, where they might at least screen them-selves from the \nfire of the foe. The roads were rough; the heat was great; the food was scant, and the \nmen weak and worn out."}

Wash-ing-ton thought this was a trick to draw his men out in-to the \nwoods, so he told them to hold their fire till the foe came in sight. But as the French did not show them-selves, though they still kept up \ntheir fire, he drew his troops back to the fort and bade them fire at \nwill, and do their best to hit their mark. The rain fell all day long, so that the men in the fort were half \ndrowned, and some of the guns scarce fit for use. The fire was kept up till eight o'clock at night, when the French \nsent word they would like to make terms with our men. Wash-ing-ton thought it was a trick to find out the state of things in \nthe fort, and for a time gave no heed to the call. The French sent two \nor three times, and at last brought the terms for Wash-ing-ton to \nread. They were in French.

They made out at last that the main terms were that the troops might \nmarch out of the fort, and fear no harm from French or red-skins as \nthey made their way back to their homes. The drums might beat and the \nflags fly, and they could take with them all the goods and stores, and \nall that was in the fort--but the large guns. These the French would \nbreak up. And our men should pledge them-selves not to build on the \nlands which were claimed by the King of France for the space of one \nyear. The weak had to yield to the strong, and Wash-ing-ton and his men laid \ndown their arms and marched out of the fort.

We will now go back to the place we left, and see where Wash-ing-ton \nwas at the close of the year 1777. He had been forced to leave New \nJer-sey in the hands of the King's troops. His own troops were worn \ndown by long and hard toil, and had need of rest. They were in want of \nclothes too, and could not keep warm in the tents, so he sought out a \nplace where they could build huts and screen them-selves from the cold \nwinds and storms. He chose Val-ley Forge, which was on the west bank of the Schuyl \n(school)-kill Riv-er, and a score of miles from Phil-a-del-phi-a. Sad was the march of the troops to Val-ley Forge. Food was scant, \ntheir clothes were worn out, and a track of blood marked the way they \ntrod. They had fought hard, but not to win, and this made their hearts \nlow. On De-cem-ber 17, they reached Val-ley Forge, and had to freeze in \ntheir tents till they could cut down the trees and build the huts they \nwere to live in.

Wash-ing-ton was kept short of funds and of troops, though he plead \nhard for both, and was sore pressed on all sides. He scarce knew what \nto do. There was but one thing he could do, and that was to wait. While his troops were in this sad plight--some of them sick un-to \ndeath--the red-coats, who held Phil-a-del-phi-a in siege, led a gay \nsort of life, and were much at their ease.

Discourage vice in every shape, and impress upon \nthe mind of every man, from the first to the lowest, the importance of the cause and what it is they are \ncontending for. Forever keep in view the necessity of guarding against surprises. In all your marches, at \ntimes, at least, even when there is no possible danger, move with front, rear, and flank guards, that they \nmay be familiarized to the use; and be regular in your encampments, appointing necessary guards for \nthe security of your camp.

The Evening of the 25th I ordered the Troops intended for this Service to parade [march] back of \nMcKonkey’s Ferry that they might begin to pass as soon as it grew dark, imagining we should be able \nto throw them all over with the necessary Artillery by 12 o’clock [midnight], and that we might easily \narrive at Trenton by five in the Morning, the distance being about nine Miles. But the quantity of Ice \nmade that Night impeded the passage of Boats so much that it was three o’clock before the Artillery \ncould all be got over, and near four before the Troops took up their line of march. This made me despair of \nsurprising the Town, as I well knew \nwe could not reach it before the day \nwas fairly broke, but as I was certain \nthere was no making a Retreat \nwithout being discovered and \nharassed on repassing the River, I \ndetermined to push on at all Events. I formed my Detachment into two \ndivisions, one to march by the lower \nor River road, the other by the upper \nor Pennington Road. As the \nDivisions had nearly the same \ndistance to march, I ordered each of \nthem, immediately upon forcing the \nout Guards, to push directly into the \nTown that they might charge the \nEnemy before they had time to \nform. The upper division arrived at \nthe Enemy’s advanced post exactly \nat eight o’clock, and in three \nMinutes after  I found from the fire \non the lower Road that that Division had also got up. The Out Guards made but small Opposition, tho’ \nfor their Numbersf they behaved very well, keeping up a constant retreating fire from behind Houses. ."}

Out of tender regard for the lives and health of His \nbrave soldiery & with surprise that so little attention is paid to \nhis orders, He again , in the most positive terms, orders and \ncommands that the Quarter -Master General apply for men \nfrom time to time to bury such dead horses as shall lay at any \nconsiderable distance from Camp . ."}

{"id": "./data/Washington/commchiefwashington.pdf", "contents": ". Of the Hospital Department \n. . . one thing which has had a very pernicious influence is the continual jealousies and altercations \nsubsisting between the hospital and regimental surgeons. They seem always to be at variance and \nrecriminating [blaming] the sufferings of the sick upon each other. . . . At all events, as the accommodation of the sick and the preservation of men’s lives are the first \nand great objects to be consulted [dealt with], the regimental surgeons ought not to be destitute of a \nreasonable quantity of medicines and other conveniences of which the sick stand in need. The ill effects \nof it are many and glaring. Either men at every slight indication of disease must be sent away to distant \nhospitals, and the army unnecessarily deprived of the services of numbers who, if the means were at \nhand, might in a day or two be restored; or they must remain without proper assistance till their diseases \nconfirm themselves and, with regard to many, get beyond the power of cure. Conclusion23 \nThe enemy have set every engine at work against us and have actually called savages and even our \nown slaves to their assistance. Would it not be well to employ two or three hundred Indians against \nGeneral Howe’s army the ensuing campaign? There is a Gentleman now in camp who would, I \nimagine, be able to bring half that number of Cherokees, and I should think, the Reverend Mr. Kirkland24 might be able to influence a like number of the Northern tribes. Such a body of Indians, \njoined by some of our woodsmen, would probably strike no small terror into the British and foreign \ntroops, particularly the newcomers. The good resulting from the measure, if these savages can be kept \nin the field at so great a distance from their native haunts, would more than compensate for the trouble \nand expense they might cost us. . . . The difficulty of getting wagoners and the enormous wages given them would tempt one to try any \nexpedient to answer the end on easier and cheaper terms. Among others, it has occurred to me whether \nit would not be eligible [advisable] to hire negroes in Carolina, Virginia and Maryland for the purpose. They ought however to be freemen, for slaves could not be sufficiently depended on. It is to be appre-\nhended they would too frequently desert to the enemy to obtain their liberty, and for the profit of it or to \nconciliate a more favorable reception would carry off their wagon-horses with them. ."}
{"id": "./data/Washington/commchiefwashington.pdf", "contents": ". . . . . One thing we have suffered much from is the want [lack] of a proper gradation of punishments: \nthe interval between a hundred lashes and death is too great and requires to be filled by some inter-\nmediate stages. Capital crimes25 in the army are frequent, particularly in the instance of desertion. Actually to inflict capital punishment upon every deserter or other heinous offender would incur the \nimputation of cruelty, and by the familiarity of the example destroy its efficacy. ."}

The disagreeable picture I have given you of the wants and sufferings of the army, and the \ndiscontents reigning among the officers, is a just representation of evils equally melancholy and \nimportant; and unless effectual remedies be applied without loss of time, the most alarming and ruinous \nconsequences are to be apprehended [foreseen]. 23 Other issues in the lengthy memo include soldiers’ pay and pensions, officers’ promotions, regimental organization and improvement, cavalry and \nartillery levels and improvements, the duties and deficiencies of the non -combat departments (engineering, provisioning, etc.), and inadequate \nprovision of clothing for the troops. 24 Rev. Samuel Kirkland was a Presbyterian missionary to the Oneida tribe. See letter of 29 March 1777. 25 Capital crimes: crimes punishable by death. 26 I.e., to execute every deserter or serious offender would result in accusations of cruelty, and the routine use of the death penalty would destroy its \npower to restrain soldiers from deserting or committing serious offenses."}

To George Clinton, Governor of New York,27 \n on the dire need for meat and other provisions for Washington’s troops. It is with great reluctance I trouble you on a subject which does not properly fall within your \nprovince [as governor], but it is a subject that occasions me more distress than I have felt since the \ncommencement of the war, and which loudly demands the most zealous exertions of every person of \nweight and authority who is interested in the success of our affairs — I mean the present dreadful \nsituation of the army for want of provisions and the miserable prospects before us with respect to \nfuturity. It is more alarming than you will probably conceive, for to form a just idea it were necessary to \nbe on the spot. For some days past, there has been little less than a famine in camp. A part of the army \nhas been a week without any kind of flesh & the rest three or four days. Naked and starving as they are, \nwe cannot enough admire the incomparable patience and fidelity of the soldiery that they have not been, \nere [before] this excited by their sufferings to a general mutiny and dispersion. Strong symptoms \nhowever of discontent have appeared in particular instances, and nothing but the most active effort \neverywhere can long avert so shocking a catastrophe. . . .

I propose to raise about one half the Number among the Southern and the Remainder among the \nNorthern Indians.

There seem to be but three Plans which may be premeditated for the next Campaign  one, the \nattempting to recover Philadelphia and destroy the enemy’s army there — another, the endeavoring to \ntransfer the war to the Northward by an enterprise against New York — and a third, the remaining quiet \nin a secure fortified Camp, disciplining and arranging the army ’till the enemy begin their operations \nand then to govern ourselves accordingly — Which of these three Plans shall we adopt?

The final peace treaty with Britain was not signed until two years later, on September 3, 1783. Washington resigned his \ncommission in late December 1783 and returned to his home at Mount Vernon, Virginia. Five years later, in January 1789, he was \ninaugurated as the first president of the United States under the new Constitution. 28 Coup de main: surprise attack; quick attack without warning (French : literally, blow or stroke of the hand). 29 Officer responsible for administering the provision and distribution of food and supplies for an army. 30 The battle, which ended in a standoff, was a strategic victory for the Americans.

As a result, the government hadn’t \ncollected more than a few pennies in taxes. So in 1773, Parliament \ncame up with another plan. It passed the Tea Act. Parliament’s new plan was clever but tricky. Parliament lowered the \nprice of the tea itself. But it also kept the tax on the tea.

Unfortunately, Parliament was “too clever for its own good.” The \nTea Act of 1773 showed how poorly Parliament understood the \ncolonists. The colonists did not care about the price of tea. They \ncared about “taxation without representation.” They were not \ngoing to pay that tea tax, no matter what British tea cost. News Travels Fast\nAs British tea ships headed for the colonies, Committees of \nCorrespondence went to work. The news spread through the \ncolonies. The Sons of Liberty prevented the tea ships from being \nunloaded in several ports. In Philadelphia, for example, the Sons of \nLiberty sent a letter to the captain of a ship waiting in the harbor \nto unload its chests of tea. “I wouldn’t try to land that tea if I were \nyou,” said the letter. “Your ship may just happen to be set on \nfire . . .” The captain got the idea and decided not to dock.

They will help us with food and \nsupplies. After we take the South, we’ll have the Continental Army \nsqueezed between our forces there and our forces in the North. The plan was pretty successful for a while. The British navy \nbrought soldiers from their base in New York to Savannah, \nGeorgia. The soldiers quickly captured the city. Within a year, they \ncontrolled the whole state of Georgia. Soon after, the British took \nCharleston, South Carolina, and handed the Americans their worst \ndefeat of the war. From there, British troops successfully went on \nto control a large part of the South. However, the British were still not able \nto crush their enemy.

{"id": "./data/Washington/WashFarewell.pdf", "contents": "Introduction Page \n(No page folio)\nINTRODUCTION\nPrepared by the United States Senate Historical Office\nIn September 1796, worn out by burdens of the presidency and attacks \nof political foes, George Washington announced his decision not to seek \na third term. With the assistance of Alexander Hamilton and James \nMadison, Washington composed in a “Farewell Address” his political \ntestament to the nation. Designed to inspire and guide future genera-\ntions, the address also set forth Washington’s defense of his administra-\ntion’s record and embodied a classic statement of Federalist doctrine. Washington’s principal concern was for the safety of the eight-year-\nold Constitution. He believed that the stability of the Republic was \nthreatened by the forces of geographical sectionalism, political faction-\nalism, and interference by foreign powers in the nation’s domestic af-\nfairs. He urged Americans to subordinate sectional jealousies to com-\nmon national interests. Writing at a time before political parties had \nbecome accepted as vital extraconstitutional, opinion-focusing agen-\ncies, Washington feared that they carried the seeds of the nation’s de-\nstruction through petty factionalism. Although Washington was in no\nsense the father of American isolationism, since he recognized the ne-\ncessity of temporary associations for “extraordinary emergencies,” he \ndid counsel against the establishment of “permanent alliances with \nother countries,” connections that he warned would inevitably be sub-\nversive of America’s national interest. Washington did not publicly deliver his Farewell Address. It first ap-\npeared on September 19, 1796, in the Philadelphia Daily American \nAdvertiser and then in papers around the country. In January 1862, with the Constitution endangered by civil war, a thou-\nsand citizens of Philadelphia petitioned Congress to commemorate the\nforthcoming 130th anniversary of George Washington’s birth by provid-\ning that “the Farewell Address of Washington be read aloud on the morn-\ning of that day in one or the other of the Houses of Congress. ” Both \nhouses agreed and assembled in the House of Representatives ’ chamber \non February 22, 1862, where Secretary of the Senate John W. Forney “ren-\ndered ‘The Farewell Address’ very effectively,” as one observer recalled. The practice of reading the Farewell Address did not immediately be-\ncome a tradition. The address was first read in regular legislative ses-\nsions of the Senate in 1888 and the House in 1899. (The House continued\nthe practice until 1984.) Since 1893 the Senate has observed \nWashington’s birthday by selecting one of its members to read the \nFarewell Address. The assignment alternates between members of each \npolitical party. At the conclusion of each reading, the appointed sena-\ntor inscribes his or her name and brief remarks in a black, leather-\nbound book maintained by the secretary of the Senate. The version of the address printed here is taken from the original of \nthe final manuscript in the New York Public Library provided courtesy \nof The Papers of George Washington. The only changes have been to \nmodernize spelling, capitalization, and punctuation."}

If in the opinion of \nthe people the distribution or modification of the \nconstitutional powers be in any particular wrong, let \nit be corrected by an amendment in the way which \nthe Constitution designates. But let there be no \nchange by usurpation; for though this, in one in-\nstance, may be the instrument of good, it is the cus-\ntomary weapon by which free governments are de-\nstroyed. The precedent must always greatly \noverbalance in permanent evil any partial or tran-\nsient benefit which the use can at any time yield."}
