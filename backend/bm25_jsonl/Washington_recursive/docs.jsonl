It ended as a global war, pitting European powers against each other in a time of intense \nimperial rivalry.  In the end, the American colonies gained their independence, ruling themselves under \nthe “firm league of friendship” known as the Articles of Confederation.  In 1789, the U.S. Constitution–\nestablishing the legislative, executive, and judicial branches - superseded the Articles of Confederation. \nTimeline of major American Revolution actions: \n• April 19, 1775:  First shots fired at Lexington and Concord in Massachusetts.

It was just a \nmonth after shots had been fired at Lexington and Concord in Massachusetts, and the Congress was \npreparing for war. They established a Continental army and elected George Washington as Commander-\nin-Chief, but the delegates also drafted the Olive Branch Petition and sent it to King George III in hopes \nof reaching a peaceful resolution. The king refused to hear the petition and declared the American \ncolonies in revolt.   \nOn June 7, 1776, Virginia delegate Richard Henry Lee put forth the resolution for independence:  \n“Resolved, that these united colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent states…”"}

On July 4, Congress voted again – this time to approve the wording of the \nDeclaration of Independence.  They didn’t actually sign the document that day.  After New York’s \ndelegates received instructions from home to vote for independence (they had initially abstained), the \ndocument was sent to Timothy Matlack to be engrossed (handwritten).

He goes on to claim that “[the Declaration’s] authority rests then on the harmonizing \nsentiments of the day.” (Jefferson to Henry Lee, May 8, 1825)  \nJefferson finished his timeless defense of “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness” in little more than \ntwo weeks, and like most writers, he was no stranger to the revision process.

Perhaps the most famous line \nstates, “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed \nby their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of \nHappiness.”  This part goes on to say that if the government tries to take these rights away, the people \nhave the right to form a new government.

In their \ncomplaints, the colonists make it clear that they are angry with the British king and government for \ntaking away their rights as English citizens.  They point out that the king has ignored or changed their \ncolonial governments, as well as their rights to a trial by jury.  The colonists accuse the king of sending a \nhired army to force them to obey unjust laws.  They say the king is “unfit to be the ruler of a free \npeople.”"}

After all, the list of \ngrievances that serves as the Declaration’s evidence seems largely anecdotal by today’s standards.

Where were they from? They were \nmainly ordinary people—farmers and people from small towns. \nMost colonists were from England, but a large number—almost \na third—came from Germany. Many others came from Scotland, \nIreland, Wales, Sweden, and the Netherlands. \nNot all of those who migrated to the \ncolonies traveled willingly.

These cities were small \nby today’s standards, but they were growing quickly. In just a few \nshort years, Philadelphia would become the second-largest city in \nthe whole British Empire next to London, England. \nWhat sparked this growth of towns and cities? Trade within the \ncolonies and with other countries was the driving factor. From \nthe docks of the cities on the East Coast, \nmerchants sent lumber, fur, salted fish, \nflour, rice, indigo, and tobacco to many \nparts of the world. To those docks, ships \nreturned with glass, paint, tea, wine, \nand other goods the colonists needed \nor wanted.\nVocabulary\ntrade, n. the \nexchange or sale of \ngoods or services.\nmerchant, n. a \nperson who sells or \ntrades goods"}

This made them \nfeel more comfortable in a strange, new land. They could speak \ntheir own language and follow their own traditional ways of life. \nThey wore the same kinds of clothing they had worn in their \nhomeland and built the same kinds of houses.\nIn time, however, something interesting and \nimportant happened.

With the assistance of Alexander Hamilton and James \nMadison, Washington composed in a “Farewell Address” his political \ntestament to the nation. Designed to inspire and guide future genera-\ntions, the address also set forth Washington’s defense of his administra-\ntion’s record and embodied a classic statement of Federalist doctrine.\nWashington’s principal concern was for the safety of the eight-year-\nold Constitution. He believed that the stability of the Republic was \nthreatened by the forces of geographical sectionalism, political faction-\nalism, and interference by foreign powers in the nation’s domestic af-\nfairs. He urged Americans to subordinate sectional jealousies to com-"}

Writing at a time before political parties had \nbecome accepted as vital extraconstitutional, opinion-focusing agen-\ncies, Washington feared that they carried the seeds of the nation’s de-\nstruction through petty factionalism. Although Washington was in no\nsense the father of American isolationism, since he recognized the ne-\ncessity of temporary associations for “extraordinary emergencies,” he \ndid counsel against the establishment of “permanent alliances with \nother countries,” connections that he warned would inevitably be sub-\nversive of America’s national interest.\nWashington did not publicly deliver his Farewell Address. It first ap-\npeared on September 19, 1796, in the Philadelphia Daily American \nAdvertiser and then in papers around the country.\nIn January 1862, with the Constitution endangered by civil war, a thou-\nsand citizens of Philadelphia petitioned Congress to commemorate the\nforthcoming 130th anniversary of George Washington’s birth by provid-"}

Forney “ren-\ndered ‘The Farewell Address’ very effectively,” as one observer recalled.\nThe practice of reading the Farewell Address did not immediately be-\ncome a tradition. The address was first read in regular legislative ses-\nsions of the Senate in 1888 and the House in 1899. (The House continued\nthe practice until 1984.) Since 1893 the Senate has observed \nWashington’s birthday by selecting one of its members to read the \nFarewell Address. The assignment alternates between members of each \npolitical party.
